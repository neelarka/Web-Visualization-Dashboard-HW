# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Here in this assigment we have used HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done earlier.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
  * The grid contains two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  * The table is a bootstrap table component.
  * The data for the table has been exactracted from the `.csv` file as HTML using a csv-to-html table conversion tool, e.g. [ConvertCSV](http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-html.htm).

The website at the top of every page have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries).
